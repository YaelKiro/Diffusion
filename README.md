# He-in-diamonds
  A solution of a one-dimensional diffusion equation describing He concentration in diamonds (sphere), affected by production (decay of U and Th) and diffusion. The solution is   by finite difference - Crank-Nicolson method.
  This model was generated for Weiss et al., 2021, Helium in diamonds unravels over a billion years of craton metasomatism, Nature Communications

- An example of an input dataset to demo the software code can be found in supplementary data table 1 at Weiss et al., 2021.
- The code runs in MATLAB
- Instructions to run the code are documented in the code file.
